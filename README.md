# AutoHDR
 
 
First of all, AutoHDR can toggle HDR mode automatically. Believe me or not, I didn't have known, that Microsoft will choose the same name for one of its feature.
 
With AutoHDR, you can created profiles which included several actions. You can set display settings like HDR, resolution or refresh or launch any other script or program.
Once you have added an application and assigned a profile to it, AutoHDR will monitor this application and will run the actions based on the assigend profile


**Features**

**Auto-Start:** This setting will create a scheduled task to run this application when the currently logged on user gets logged on.  
**Profiles:** You can create profiles which contain actions to be run on application events. The possible events are "Started", "Closed", "Got focus", "Lost focus".
**Profile actions:** For now, you can set up "Display actions" (HDR, resolution, refresh rate) and "Run program" actions, to run any program or script as you want. I plan to implement other actions to integrate with third party apps like MSI Afterburner, etc.
**Application assignment:** You can assign one profile to different applications. 
**Compatibility mode (Restart):** In some games, e.g. Cyberpunk 2077,  you don't see any HDR options in settings, when HDR was not enabled in Windows before the game was launched. Therefore, the application kills the process on the first occurence, activates hdr and restarts the process.  
**Auto HDR per monitor:** Select which monitors you want to control with AutoHDR
