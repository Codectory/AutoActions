# AutoHDR
 
 
First of all, AutoHDR can toggle HDR mode automatically. Believe me or not, I didn't have known, that Microsoft will choose the same name for one of its feature.
 
With AutoHDR, you can created profiles which included several actions. You can set display settings like HDR, resolution or refresh or launch any other script or program.
Once you have added an application and assigned a profile to it, AutoHDR will monitor this application and will run the actions based on the assigend profile


##  Features

##### Auto-Start
This setting will create a scheduled task to run this application when the currently logged on user gets logged on. 
##### Profiles
You can create profiles which contain actions to be run on application events. The possible events are "Started", "Closed", "Got focus", "Lost focus".
##### Profile actions
###### Display action
Change HDR, resolution, refresh rate and color depth
###### Audio action
Audio action Change default playback or record audio device.
###### Run or close program action
Run any program or script as you want or kill running proccesses.
###### Reference action
Reference action Reference to another profile.
##### Application assignment
You can assign one profile to different applications. 
##### Shortcut
Create shortcut actions and access them in the status view or from the tray icon.
##### Compatibility mode (Restart)
In some games, e.g. Cyberpunk 2077,  you don't see any HDR options in settings, when HDR was not enabled in Windows before the game was launched. Therefore, the application kills the process on the first occurence, activates hdr and restarts the process.  
##### Auto HDR per monitor
Select which monitors you want to control with AutoHDR
