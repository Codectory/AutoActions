# AutoActions

With AutoActions, you can created profiles which included several actions. You can change display settings, set default audio devices or launch any other script or program.
Once you have added an application and assigned a profile to it, AutoActions will monitor this application and will run the actions based on the assigned profile.

##### Profile actions

##### Compatibility mode (Restart)
In some games, e.g. Cyberpunk 2077,  you don't see any HDR options in settings, when HDR was not enabled in Windows before the game was launched. Therefore, the application kills the process on the first occurence, activates hdr and restarts the process.
